\section{Week - 01}
\subsection*{Wednesday(Jan 1, 2025)}A very very \textbf{Happy New Year!} to you all and to me also. I had spend last week with my beautiful wife in Boston. We had good times living together and I was taking care of her. She was not well so we cancelled to roam around the city and planned to do it later in the year when I visit her again which might be most probably in summer of 2025. 

I had my flight early morning today from Logan International airport, Boston to Richmond, VA. This flight experience was not good as there were lots of turbulence in the way. However, we landed safely at Richmond airport. I had my car parked in the Econ lot B and I had to pay \$55.0 for the parking, which is reasonable for 7 days of parking.I reached home around 3:00 pm because I preferred to take US$-60$ for smooth and comfortable ride. On my way home, I stopped at chipotle and got some food for me for about \$16.07. 

I took some rest and then I went with Aasutosh for an evening walk to Stadium and on our way back we stopped at Food Lion. On our way back we decided to have some beer and got some at Aasutosh's place. We ate and drink alongside watching a movie, \textbf{JAWAAN}. I was partially drunk as this was my alcohol consumption after so many time. We planned to visit Dipin at his place the next day cause Dipin just had his shoulder surgery on 31st December 2024. This is most of the thing which I had done on this day. I will keep updating this journal on daily basis.\\
Expenses of the day:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Parking at Richmond International Airport, Boston: \$55.0
    \item Food at Chipotle: \$16.07.
\end{enumerate}
Total Expenses: \textbf{\$ 71.07}
\subsection*{Thursday(Jan 2, 2025)}
Hello everyone, I am back again. I had a wonderful sleep last night as I was little bit drunk. I woke up late and then I talked to family back home in India. I decided to make brunch instead of breakfast and lunch. I completed my grocery list, did complete this Daily Journal related thing on Visual studio code and also did some reading. I had brunch, and at 4:00 pm I got call from Pankaj asking to leave from my car to Dipin's place. I, Aasutosh, and Pankaj left to Dipin's place at 5:20 pm and stayed there for like 1 hour. We had some fun time and asked a lot about his surgery. That was good to see his girlfriend, Didie taking care of him. We left from there at 6:30 pm  and I dropped both Aasutosh and Pankaj at their place.

I had some serious talks with my fiance about the wedding in April, she was so much stressed and we figured out that let's postponed it for some time. However, she called her mother and we were there on conference call with her. The call helped her to finalize that she will ask her supervisor next day about the holiday for wedding and will finalize the other related stuff later on. I had my dinner and then I went to watch a movie, \textbf{JOLLY LLB}. I had a good time watching it. I will keep updating this journal on daily basis.
\subsection*{Friday (Jan 3, 2025)}
Hello everyone, I am back again. I planned to do the cleaning of my luggages, settle the stuffs in a good way and then threw away all the papers which are not required. I completed that and had oats and milk for breakfast. This made me realized that I do not have enough food to cook/eat. I decided to go for Grocery and went for it in afternoon. I got some food for me and then I had my lunch, there was some rice, I mixed them with eggs and had egg-fried rice. I had updated my Cashbook application of the expenses for the last 2 days I have made. I was informed by my fiance that her supervisor will talk about her holiday related stuff at 3:30 pm so I will be free at that time, incase he wants me also to join the meeting over zoom. I didn't join the meeting as he was only talking to her about her research work and also related to their project. He agreed to give her holiday for the wedding. I was happy to hear that. I went to gym later in the evening at 5:00 pm and did upper body workout. I had good workout and came back home, ate peanut butter sandwich with protein smoothie. I did talk with my fiance and then updated the expenses of a day. I decided to watch \textbf{SUITS} on Netflix. I am planning to finish this series first and then move to another one. I will keep updating this journal on daily basis.\\
Expenses of the day:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Grocery at Aldi: \$ 43.32
    \item Grocery at Food Lion: \$ 15.40
\end{enumerate}
Total Expenses: \textbf{\$ 58.72}
